1. **OAuth 2.0**: An open standard for token-based authentication and authorization. It allows third-party services to access user information without exposing user passwords. OAuth 2.0 is used by many large organizations, including Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, to allow users to log into their services with third-party credentials.

2. **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**: An identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows clients to verify the identity of the end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server. It's commonly used for single sign-on (SSO) and identity federation.

3. **Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)**: An XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties. SAML is typically used for Single Sign-On (SSO) for enterprise users and provides a way to authenticate users across different domains.

4. **JSON Web Token (JWT)**: A compact, URL-safe token format that's designed for space efficiency and used often in web applications. JWTs can be signed and optionally encrypted, and they're used in a variety of security and identity contexts.

5. **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: A service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. It enables you to manage permissions to various resources and apply these permissions across your AWS environment.

6. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: A widely used approach that restricts network access based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. In this context, access decisions are based on several factors, including job competency, responsibility, and authority.

7. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: A more flexible approach compared to RBAC. In ABAC, access rights are granted to users through the use of policies that combine attributes together.

8. **Apache Shiro**: A powerful Java security framework that's easy to understand and use. It provides authentication, authorization, cryptography, and session management features.

9. **Spring Security**: A framework that provides comprehensive security features for Java applications. It's highly customizable and integrates well with Spring applications.

10. **Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC)**: An advanced method that uses business policies to determine access rights. The policies can be based on a wide variety of attributes, including user information, actions, resources, and environmental conditions.
